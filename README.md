# dApp that was built to learn how to display the ENS for an address if it has one.

In this project I'm going to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to create the app, alongside the ethers.js and web3Modal libraries. Everything is gonna be running in the Rinkeby testnet.
